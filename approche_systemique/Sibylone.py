This code models a system where consultants and candidates interact. The `ConsultantModel` class represents this system using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It includes methods to solve the ODEs and plot the results.

**Key aspects:**

1.  **Constants**: The script begins by defining constants for various rates in the system, such as departure rate, arrival rate, interview rate, rejection rate, and acceptance rate.
2.  **ConsultantModel Class**: This class encapsulates the model's behavior, including its parameters (rates) and methods to solve the ODEs (`solve`) and plot the results (`plot_results`).
3.  **ODE Solution**: The `odeint` function from SciPy is used to solve the system of ODEs defined in the `model` method.
4.  **Plotting Results**: The script includes a function (`plot_results`) to visualize the number of consultants and candidates over time, providing insight into how these populations change.
5.  **Causal Loop Diagram**: A causal loop diagram is plotted using NetworkX to illustrate the relationships between different components of the system (arrivals, departures, consultants, candidates, interviews, rejections, and acceptances).
6.  **Main Execution**: In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, an instance of the `ConsultantModel` is created with specified rates, solved for a given initial state and time span, and then plotted to display the dynamics of the system.

**Notes:**

*   The model assumes that the rates are constant over time.
*   Initial conditions (e.g., 100 consultants and 50 candidates) can be adjusted as needed.
*   Time points (`t`) for solving the ODEs can also be modified according to specific requirements.
